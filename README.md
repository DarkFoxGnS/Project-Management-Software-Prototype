#Project Management Software Prototype
Project work for IU by Tibor Péter Szabó.
For the project to work, it is a requirement to have Python3 installed on the computer.
To access the application use "localhost" in any browser after the server is running.
To log into the application you can use any username and password combination, as the server does not check for validity as this is only a prototype, and not a finished product.
